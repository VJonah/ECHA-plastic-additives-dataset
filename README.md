# README
## Introduction
This repository contains a notebook to generate a complete dataset of the plastic additives that resulted from ECHA's [plastic additives initiative](https://echa.europa.eu/plastic-additives-initiative). 
## Installation

After cloning the repository, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages in your environment; create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) if needs be. 

## Usage

Launch jupyter notebook and simply open and run `Complete Additives Dataset Creation.ipynb`. Note that intermediary files will be created on your system as the notebook runs including datasets and cached webpages. The final dataset is called `infocard_expanded_additives_dataset.tsv`.
